# Tracer Perpetual Pools

Project base generated with the Typescript Solidity Dev Starter Kit. See [Blog Post](https://medium.com/@rahulsethuram/the-new-solidity-dev-stack-buidler-ethers-waffle-typescript-tutorial-f07917de48ae) for more details
## Frontend Notes
### Calculating ABDKMathQuad values
The `PoolSwapLibrary` contains several methods for generating, converting, and using the raw ratio values. These can be used in the frontend to estimate the result of a transaction. It is vital when estimating the result of a transaction that the shadow pool amount for the commit type's opposite is included in the token total supply.

## Environment variables
The environment variables used in this project are documented in the `example.env` file at the root of the project. To configure, create a copy of `example.env`, rename to `.env`, and replace the placeholders with the correct values. 

## Using this Project

Install the dependencies with `yarn`. 
Build everything with `yarn compile`. 
Run the tests with `yarn test`.

## Available Functionality

### Build Contracts and Generate Typechain Typeings
You'll need to run this before running tests if typescript throws an error about not finding the typechain artifacts.

`yarn refresh`

### Run Slither for static analysis report
If you have `slither` installed and on your PATH, you can run `npm run slither` to get a report on the current codebase.

 
### Deploy to Ethereum

Create/modify network config in `hardhat.config.ts` and add API key and private key, then run:

`npx hardhat run --network rinkeby scripts/deploy.ts`
**Note:** As of this commit, deploys are out of sync with the current contract set-up and therefore will not work.

### Verify on Etherscan

Using the [hardhat-etherscan plugin](https://hardhat.org/plugins/nomiclabs-hardhat-etherscan.html), add Etherscan API key to `hardhat.config.ts`, then run:

`npx hardhat verify --network rinkeby <DEPLOYED ADDRESS>`

PRs and feedback welcome!

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How are pool keepers to be chosen? How many keepers are there?** 

The Pool Keeper is simply a contract that enforces the correct keeper behaviour. Anyone may be a keeper by calling the keeper function on that contract with a pool that is valid for upkeep. We will initially be adding wrappers for Chainlink keepers as well as having custom keepers.

**The leveraged pool fee is represented as a `bytes16` value. Why is this chosen over something like `uint`? What denomination does this represent?**

The leveraged pool fee is a `bytes16` value simply due to the maths library used. We often represent values in WAD values (popularised by the Maker DAO team). WAD values are the integer value multiplied by 10^18 (e.g. `1 = 1*10^18`). The maths library we currently use represents values in IEEE quad precision numbers and uses bytes as way of storing this. A good primer on the above can be found [here](https://medium.com/coinmonks/math-in-solidity-part-1-numbers-384c8377f26d) and WAD / RAY maths is introduced [here](https://docs.makerdao.com/other-documentation/system-glossary).

**How many different type of tests are there? There are unit tests in the test suite. Are there also end to end tests?**

Most tests are unit tests. There is a single E2E test in `e2e.spec.ts` right now. We plan to add more.

**Whats the `deployments/kovan` folder for? They seem to be different from the ABIs I get from `artifacts` folder when I compile.**

We use a plugin for hardhat called hardhat deploy that helps with deployment. They recommend you commit the `deployments` folder to have consistent data across deploys. The deploys you find there will be deploys that have been run from old versions of the contract, hence the ABI difference.
